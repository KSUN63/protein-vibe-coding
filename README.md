# Protein Vibe Coding ðŸ§¬âœ¨

Welcome to the **Protein Vibe Coding** repository! This is a collection of exploratory, creative, and experimental code for protein-related computational tasks. The philosophy here is "vibe coding" - intuitive, rapid prototyping and exploration of protein data, structures, and analysis without getting bogged down in heavy frameworks or complex setups.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is about:
- **Quick experimentation** with protein data and structures
- **Intuitive exploration** of biological concepts through code
- **Rapid prototyping** of analysis pipelines
- **Learning by doing** with minimal setup friction
- **Sharing insights** and cool discoveries along the way

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is a growing collection of protein-related computational experiments that I'll be adding to over time. As I explore different aspects of protein analysis, you'll gradually find:
- Protein sequence analysis and manipulation
- Structure data processing and visualization
- Bioinformatics workflows and utilities
- Data exploration notebooks
- Quick scripts for common protein tasks
- Creative approaches to protein data science

Each addition will come with my thoughts, findings, and lessons learned along the way. Check back regularly for new content!

## Philosophy

The goal is to make protein computational biology more accessible and fun. Whether you're:
- A computational biologist looking for quick tools
- A data scientist curious about proteins
- A student learning bioinformatics
- Someone who just thinks proteins are cool

You'll find something useful here!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Conda or Mamba (recommended for environment management)

### Setup
